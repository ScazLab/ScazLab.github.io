We are currently looking for students to help with our research projects. If you are interested please send us an email: [Alessandro](mailto:alessandro.rancone@yale.edu) and [Olivier](mailto:olivier.mangin@yale.edu). Please also feel free to join one of our [lab meetings on Tuesdays at 4pm](http://scazlab.yale.edu/news/fall-semester-lab-meetings-update) to directly have a chat.

Our current projects focus on human robot collaboration, that is how to build robot that helps humans building things. We are particularly interested in studying the communication that happens during this collaboration. In other words, robot that can talk to better help you building these things.

A background in cognitive sciences, psychology, computer science, mathematics, or mechanical engineering might turn helpful!

Here is a list of tasks we would typically need your help on.
=======

## Available projects

### User Study

We are close to start a 40 people user study to investigate when communication is useful to overcome uncertainty in collaboration.

### Improvements to the Baxter Software

We are looking for two/three people to work on robotics engineering tasks with the Baxter robot. The following is a non-exhaustive list of potential projects:

#### Perception

Currently, the perception system relies on fiducial marker tracking (see below). A lot of other things need to be perceived in a collaborative scene.

#### Control

Improve the robot's action capabilities. For example implementing more diverse grasping behaviors for more actions.

#### Human-Robot Interaction

In particular we are planning to investigate actions that are highly collaborative: action in which each participant has to continuously adapt and react to their teammates' behaviors. Typical such actions are supportive actions like holding a part for someone else working on it.

### Support on ideation/implementation of new/more complex interaction scenarios

We are working on new experimental scenarios and need help on designing these. This includes things as diverse as participating to the general setup of the experiment to designing parts of building tasks as well as 3D printing, laser cutting and painting them!

### Research projects

We have multiple ideas we would like to investigate in the medium term. If you're interested, we can talk about a research project to do under our supervision, which hopefully should lead to a publication.

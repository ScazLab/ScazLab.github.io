Welcome to the Setup and Startup Guide for the Kuka robot.

<!-- More -->

## Ubuntu System

The following instructions has been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 only.
- You can get the 64 bits system [here](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/).
- To create a bootable USB, please refer to information [here](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-windows#0).
- You are recommended to partition the harddrive with the `Disks` that comes with Ubuntu. Otherwise, you might see this during installation:
> The partition * assigned to / starts at an offset of * bytes from the minimum alignment for this disk, which may lead to very poor performance.

Ubuntu doesn't automatically use the nvidia driver. You can search for Additional Drivers to use them. You might need to setup the correct ppa

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:xorg-edgers/ppa -y
sudo apt-get update
```


## ROS

The version `indigo` is used for Kuka. Basically, you just need to follow [these instructions](http://wiki.ros.org/indigo/Installation/Ubuntu), or the following instructions copied below for your convenience.

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver 'hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80' --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654
```

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install dpkg
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-desktop-full
```

```bash
sudo rosdep init
rosdep update
```

```bash
echo "source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

```bash
sudo apt install python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential
```

You are also recommended to get the catkin tools, the official installation guide is [here](https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html):

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu `lsb_release -sc` main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
wget http://packages.ros.org/ros.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
```

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-catkin-tools
```

## Kuka ROS driver

You will need to install the Youbot ros driver, the instruction was referenced from [here](http://www.youbot-store.com/wiki/index.php/ROS_Wrapper):

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-youbot-driver
```

Next install the ros interface

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-youbot-driver-ros-interface ros-indigo-youbot-description
sudo setcap cap_net_raw+ep /opt/ros/indigo/lib/youbot_driver_ros_interface/youbot_driver_ros_interface
sudo ldconfig /opt/ros/indigo/lib
```

If you see the error that libYouBotDriver.so cannot be found, run the command again (or remove the all drivers and reinstall them again):
```bash
sudo ldconfig /opt/ros/indigo/lib
```

## Install moveit lib and other ros dependencies

```bash
sudo apt-get install python-wstool ros-indigo-roscpp ros-indigo-pluginlib ros-indigo-urdf \
  ros-indigo-tf-conversions ros-indigo-joint-state-publisher \
  ros-indigo-robot-state-publisher ros-indigo-xacro \
  ros-indigo-moveit-core ros-indigo-moveit-ros-move-group \
  ros-indigo-moveit-planners-ompl ros-indigo-moveit-ros-visualization
```

## Config the driver for arm-only

The driver installed is configed as a Youbot with a base, but we only have an arm. Two changes needs to be made, one is the launch file, and the other is the manipulator config.

### Launch file

The launch file is `youbot_driver.launch` in the `package youbot_driver_ros_interface`. If you followed the previous installation instructions, it should be located at `/opt/ros/indigo/share/youbot_driver_ros_interface/launch`. You should create another launch file called `youbot_driver_arm_only.launch`, and copy and paste the file contents from `youbot_driver.launch`. Open `youbot_driver_arm_only.launch`

#### Change 1: modify line 16

from: 
```xml
<param name="youBotHasBase" type="bool" value="true"/>
```

to:
```xml
<param name="youBotHasBase" type="bool" value="false"/>
```
#### Change 2: comment line 37
From:
```xml
<param name="youBotBaseName" type="str" value="youbot-base"/>
```
To:
```xml
<!-- <param name="youBotBaseName" type="str" value="youbot-base"/> -->
```

#### Change 3: comment line 43
From:
```xml
<remap from="base/joint_states" to="/joint_states"/> 
```
To:
```xml
<!-- <remap from="base/joint_states" to="/joint_states"/>  -->
```

#### Change 4: modify line 48

from: 
```xml
<param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro.py '$(find youbot_description)/robots/youbot.urdf.xacro'"/>
```

to:
```xml
<param name="robot_description" command="$(find xacro)/xacro.py '$(find youbot_description)/robots/youbot_arm_only.urdf.xacro'"/>
```

### Robot config file

The config file `youbot-manipulator.cfg` is located at `/opt/ros/indigo/share/youbot_driver/config`. You can just follow the following instructions from [official instructions](http://www.youbot-store.com/wiki/index.php/Using_different_youBot_configuration#Using_arm_only) to modify it.

Basically, you just need to change the `JointTopology` (and do not modify anything else) to:

```
[JointTopology]
ManipulatorJoint1 = 1
ManipulatorJoint2 = 2
ManipulatorJoint3 = 3
ManipulatorJoint4 = 4
ManipulatorJoint5 = 5
```

### Notice

The joint limits showed in <http://www.youbot-store.com/wiki/index.php/YouBot_Detailed_Specifications> does *NOT* match the actual joint limit. The actual joint limit should be (unit: degrees):

```(text)
joint_1: 0 to (169 + 169)
joint_2: 0 to (90 + 65)
joint_3: -(146 + 151) to 0
joint_4: 0 to (102.5 + 102.5)
joint_5: 0 to (167.5 + 167.5)
```

## Install IK solver and Youbot moveit

Create a folder to install all ros libs, the lib is called `ros_lib_ws` on the Kuka computer. 

```bash
cd ~
mkdir ros_lib_ws
cd ros_lib_ws
mkdir src
catkin build
```

Then download the solver and youbot moveit

```
cd src
git clone https://github.com/ScazLab/youbot-manipulation.git
cd ..
catkin build
```

To work with the youbot moveit, you also need to update the urdf file of the robot. It is located at `/opt/ros/indigo/share/youbot_description\robots\youbot_arm_only.urdf.xacro`. Add the following to the end of the robot description:

```xml
  <link name="virtual_ee_link" />
  <joint name="virtual_ee_joint" type="fixed">
    <parent link="gripper_palm_link" />
    <child link = "virtual_ee_link" />
    <origin xyz="0.0 0.0 0.04" rpy="0.0 0.0 0.0" />
    <!-- <origin xyz="0.0 0.0 0.1445" rpy="0.0 0.0 0.0" /> -->
  </joint>
```

You will need to source ros_lib_ws so that ros can find it. You can add the information with echo, or you can edit the bash file with whatever text editor you like, in the example below, we used [sublime](http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2013/12/install-sublime-text-3-ubuntu-14-04-trusty/)

```bash
subl ~/.bashrc
```

and add `source ~/ros_lib_ws/devel/setup.bash` to the last line and save it


## Kuka Gazebo Simulator

Documentation [here](http://www.youbot-store.com/wiki/index.php/Gazebo_simulation)

```bash
sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-ros-control ros-indigo-ros-controllers ros-indigo-gazebo-ros-control
cd ~/ros_lib_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/ScazLab/youbot_simulation.git
cd ..
catkin build
```

Note that we skipped cloning the description as in the documentation, as it was already installed in the previous step. And then run catkin build

To launch it, run (start in a new terminal):
```bash
roslaunch youbot_gazebo_robot youbot_arm_only.launch 
```

## run the hello world program

### Create your workspace 

Please feel free to create the directory anywhere you want and with any names you like

```bash
mkdir -p ~/ros_devel_ws/src
cd ~/ros_devel_ws
catkin build
```

Later you can save all your projects in ros_devel_src . The same rules applies to the Kuka laptop.


```bash
echo "source ~/ros_devel_ws/devel/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### download the example

```bash
cd ~/ros_devel_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/wnowak/youbot_ros_samples
```

Since we don't have a base, the example needs to be modified. Open the file `youbot_ros_hello_world.cpp` located at `~\ros_devel_ws_src\youbot_ros_examples\youbot_ros_hello_world\src`

Comment out line 141:

```cpp
// movePlatform();
```

Compile the code:

```bash
cd ~/ros_devel_ws/
catkin build
```

### Run the example

#### Run it on a real robot arm

First start the robot:

```bash
roslaunch youbot_driver_ros_interface youbot_driver_arm_only.launch
```

Then run the example:

```bash
rosrun youbot_ros_hello_world youbot_ros_hello_world
```

## Other

### Change the grasp force

Changing StallGuard2Threshold in the config file (..../youbot_driver/config/youbot-manipulator.cfg). It is a value between -63 to 64. reference is here: [https://janpaulus.github.io/dd/d6c/classyoubot_1_1_stall_guard2_threshold.html]

### use API without ROS example

[https://janpaulus.github.io/da/d1b/usage.html]

If import youbot lib doesn't work, and gives the osal.h error, change `# include <osal.h>` to `#include </opt/ros/indigo/include/youbot_driver/soem/osal/osal.h>` in youbot-driver.

We are currently looking for students to help with our research projects. If you are interested please send us an email: [Alessandro](mailto:alessandro.rancone@yale.edu) and [Olivier](mailto:olivier.mangin@yale.edu). Please also feel free to join one of our [lab meetings on Tuesdays at 4pm](http://scazlab.yale.edu/news/fall-semester-lab-meetings-update) to directly have a chat.

Our current projects focus on human robot collaboration, that is how to build robot that helps humans building things. We are particularly interested in studying the communication that happens during this collaboration. In other words, robot that can talk to better help you building these things.

A background in cognitive sciences, psychology, computer science, mathematics, or mechanical engineering might turn helpful!

Here is a list of tasks we would typically need your help on.
=======

## Available projects

### User Study

We are close to start a 40 people user study to investigate

### Improvements to the Baxter Software

We are looking for two/three people to work on robotics engineering tasks with the Baxter robot. The following is a non-exhaustive list of potential projects:

#### Perception

Currently, the perception system relies on fiducial marker tracking (see below)

#### Control

Improve the robot's action capabilities:

#### Human-Robot Interaction

### Support on ideation/implementation of new/more complex interaction scenarios



### Research projects

We have multiple ideas we would like to investigate in the medium term. If you're interested, we can talk about a research project to do under our supervision, which hopefully should lead to a publication.

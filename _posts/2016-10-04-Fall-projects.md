We are currently looking for students to help with our research projects. If you are interested please send us an email: [Alessandro](mailto:alessandro.rancone@yale.edu) and [Olivier](mailto:olivier.mangin@yale.edu). Please also feel free to join one of our [lab meetings on Tuesdays at 4pm](http://scazlab.yale.edu/news/fall-semester-lab-meetings-update) to directly have a chat.

Our current projects focus on human robot collaboration, that is how to build robot that helps humans building things. We are particularly interested in studying the communication that happens during this collaboration. In other words, robot that can talk to better help you building these things.

A background in cognitive sciences, psychology, computer science, mathematics, or mechanical engineering might turn helpful!
